                        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
                        <p>In my Country, during holidays a lot of people travel from cities to their home villages.
                            This means very
                            long queues at the bus terminals and long waiting hours before one can board a bus. The
                            buses are often
                            overloaded with seated and standing passengers and the journey lasts several hours, with no
                            air
                            conditioning. While those who travel in private cars have empty seats and are willing to
                            give rides. My
                            idea is to have a website where private car owners can connect with and give rides to other
                            travelers
                            headed in their direction. Fuel costs will be shared so both parties will benefit.</p>

                        <h2>Intended Target Audience</h2>
                        <p>General public in need of safer and more conducive ways of travel.</p>

                    <div class="why">
                        <h2>Why will people come to the site?</h2>
                        <p>Those who wish to travel anywhere in the country will visit the website and check first if
                            there is anyone headed to their destination. They will visit the website because it offers
                            them an alternative or another choice.</p>

                        <h2>What questions will visitors/users expect is answered by your site content?</h2>
                        <p>Idealy for such a platform to work, users will need reasurance that fellow travellers are
                            safe people to travel with.
                            Hence a need for some identification and verification may later arise, users will need to
                            create profiles with their background.
