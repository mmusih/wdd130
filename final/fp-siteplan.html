            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>In my Country, during holidays a lot of people travel from cities to their home villages. This means very
                long queues at the bus terminals and long waiting hours before one can board a bus. The buses are often
                overloaded with seated and standing passengers and the journey lasts several hours, with no air
                conditioning. While those who travel in private cars have empty seats and are willing to give rides. My
                idea is to have a website where private car owners can connect with and give rides to other travelers
                headed in their direction. Fuel costs will be shared so both parties will benefit.</p>
